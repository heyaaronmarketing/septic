Cleaning your windows isn’t just about aesthetics. Routine maintenance offers tangible benefits:

1. **Extends the life of your windows.** Dirt, hard water and environmental pollutants can etch the glass over time. Regular washing prevents permanent damage and costly replacements.
2. **Improves energy efficiency.** Dirty windows block natural sunlight, forcing you to rely more on artificial light and heating. Clean windows let in warmth and reduce your energy bill.
3. **Enhances curb appeal.** Whether you’re hosting a barbecue or putting your home on the market, sparkling glass makes a big difference in how your property is perceived.
4. **Boosts mood and productivity.** Studies show that access to natural light improves mood and productivity. A clearer view can literally brighten your day.
