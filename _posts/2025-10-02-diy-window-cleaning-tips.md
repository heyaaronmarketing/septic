We love cleaning your windows for you, but sometimes you just need to tackle a quick touch‑up between professional visits. Here are a few pro tips you can use at home:

* **Skip the newspaper.** It was all the rage in the ’90s, but modern ink smears. Use a microfiber cloth or a squeegee instead.
* **Use the right solution.** A mixture of distilled water, a drop of dish soap and a cup of white vinegar works wonders. Avoid using hard tap water — minerals leave spots.
* **Work on a cloudy day.** Direct sunlight dries the cleaning solution too quickly, leaving streaks.
* **Wipe edges dry.** After each pass with the squeegee, wipe the blade and the window edges with a clean cloth to prevent drips.

Of course, there’s a limit to DIY. For multi‑story homes, tricky screens or heavy buildup, it’s safer to bring in professionals. Check out our [services]({{ site.baseurl }}/services/) page or [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) to schedule a time that works for you.
