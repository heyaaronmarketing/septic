You’ve booked your cleaning — what’s next? While we handle the heavy lifting, a little preparation helps ensure a smooth appointment:

1. **Clear access.** Move any furniture, planters or decorative items away from the windows, both inside and out. This saves time and prevents accidents.
2. **Remove screens and curtains.** If possible, take down window treatments and screens before we arrive. Don’t worry if you can’t — we can do it for you.
3. **Secure pets.** We love furry friends, but they can be curious about ladders and equipment. For everyone’s safety, keep pets in a separate room during the cleaning.
4. **Point out problem areas.** Let us know about any problem spots (sticky sashes, hard‑to‑reach windows) so we can plan accordingly.

That’s it! We’ll take care of the rest. Feel free to ask questions on the day of service — we’re happy to explain our process.
