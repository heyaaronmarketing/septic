Texas weather can be unpredictable, but planning your window care around the seasons makes maintenance easier:

* **Spring:** Clean away winter dirt, pollen and dust. Inspect caulking and weatherstripping to prepare for heavy spring rains.
* **Summer:** Hard water spots from sprinklers and afternoon storms are common. Light touch‑ups between professional cleanings keep glass clear.
* **Fall:** Falling leaves clog gutters and collect on windowsills. Combine your window washing with gutter cleaning for best results.
* **Winter:** Although freezes are rare in {{ site.service_city }}, the low sun angle highlights streaks and smudges. A mid‑winter wash keeps things bright during shorter days.

Scheduling professional cleaning at least twice a year (spring and fall) is a good starting point for most East Texas homes. Need a custom maintenance plan? [Reach out]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).
