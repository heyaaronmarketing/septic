When you search for a window cleaner, you’re bound to see both locally owned businesses and large franchise operations. Which one should you choose? Like most things in life, it depends.

**Local companies** (like ours) often provide more personalized service. We know the quirks of East Texas weather and take pride in every job because our reputation is on the line. We’re flexible, responsive and can make decisions on the spot without asking a corporate head office.

**Franchises**, on the other hand, benefit from national marketing budgets and standardized processes. You might find slick branding and uniformed technicians, but you may also encounter upselling and less flexibility.

The right choice ultimately comes down to your priorities: do you value a relationship with a business owner who lives in your community, or does a recognizable brand make you feel more comfortable? For most homeowners we talk to, supporting local just feels right.

If you’re curious about how we stack up against the big guys, [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) and we’ll happily answer your questions — no sales pitch required.
